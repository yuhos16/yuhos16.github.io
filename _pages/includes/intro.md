# 👤 Bio

I am currently a **M.Phil Student** in **Computer Science** at the [School of Data Science (SDS)](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/), The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. I am a member of the **HEAL Group**, advised by [Prof. Juexiao Zhou](https://www.joshuachou.ink/about/).


My primary research interest is **AI for Healthcare**, with a particular emphasis on **Medical Vision Language Models (VLMs), LLM Reasoning and Medical Imaging**. I’m passionate about developing intelligent medical systems that can be safely deployed in real clinical settings, helping doctors make better decisions, streamline workflows, and ultimately improve patient outcomes and the quality of care that patients receive.

I'm always open to academic discussions, potential collaborations and interdisciplinary projects. Feel free to reach out at: **yuhaoshen [at] link [dot] cuhk [dot] edu [dot] cn**.
