I am currently a **M.Phil Student** in **Computer Science** at the [School of Data Science (SDS)](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/), The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. I am a member of the **HEAL Group**, advised by [Prof. Juexiao Zhou](https://www.joshuachou.ink/about/).


In the long term, I aim to develop reliable AI systems that can truly benefit real-world clinical practice. My primary research interest lies in **AI for Healthcare**, with a particular emphasis on the following three areas:
