# 👤 Bio

I am currently a **M.Phil Student** in **Computer Science** at the [School of Data Science (SDS)](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/), The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. As a member of the **HEAL Group**, I am fortunate to work under the supervision of [Prof. Juexiao Zhou](https://www.joshuachou.ink/about/).


In the long term, I aim to develop reliable AI systems that can truly benefit real-world clinical practice. My primary research interest lies in **AI for Healthcare**, with a particular emphasis on the following three areas:

<div class="vitem"><span class="accent-bar-sm"></span> <strong>LLM Reasoning & Reinforcement learning</strong></div>
<div class="vitem"><span class="accent-bar-sm"></span> <strong>Medical Imaging & Computer Vision</strong></div>

I'm always open to academic discussions, potential collaborations and interdisciplinary projects. Feel free to reach out at: **yuhaoshen [at] link [dot] cuhk [dot] edu [dot] cn**.
