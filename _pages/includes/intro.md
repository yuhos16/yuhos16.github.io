Hello! My primary research interest is **AI for Healthcare**. As a member of the [HEAL Group](https://www.joshuachou.ink/about/), I work under the supervision of [Prof. Juexiao Zhou](https://www.joshuachou.ink/about/). I focus on building dependable AI systems for real clinical use, emphasizing safety, transparency, and rigorous evaluation. My current work centers on the following three areas:
